# Document Refactoring and Migration Summary

## 📋 Refactoring Overview

Based on user feedback, we have redesigned and migrated the functional operation documentation originally located in `docs/user/functional-operations/` to better serve the goal of AI-driven automated testing.

## 🎯 Refactoring Goals

### Original Issues
1.  **User Needs Mismatch** - Users generally do not need such detailed operational documentation.
2.  **Inappropriate Directory Location** - Placing it in the `user` directory did not align with its actual purpose.
3.  **Unclear Testing Objectives** - The focus should be on discovering bugs, not just verifying normal workflows.

### Refactoring Objectives
1.  **Focus on Bug Discovery** - Design test scenarios specifically for finding issues.
2.  **Logical Directory Structure** - Place testing documents in a dedicated testing directory.
3.  **Simplified User Documentation** - Provide users with a concise and practical quick-start guide.

## 📁 New Directory Structure

```

├── user/
│   └── quick-start.md              # Concise quick-start guide for users
└── testing/
    └── ai-automation/              # AI-driven automated testing system
        ├── README.md               # General introduction to the testing system

## 🎯 Shift in Testing Focus

### From Feature Validation to Bug Discovery
**Before:** Verifying if a feature works correctly.
```markdown
Verification Points:
- [ ] The prompt has been successfully entered into the text box.
- [ ] The optimization process has started successfully.
- [ ] The optimized prompt is displayed on the right side.
```

**Now:** Focusing on discovering potential issues.
```markdown
Expected Issues to Discover:
- Abnormal scrolling in the input box
- UI freezing or unresponsiveness
- High memory usage
- Optimization timeout or failure
- Abnormal display of results
```

### From Normal Flow to Edge Cases
**Before:** Testing standard user operation flows.
```javascript
browser_type(element="Original Prompt Input Box", ref="e54", text="Please help me write an article about the history of artificial intelligence development");
```

**Now:** Testing extreme and abnormal situations.
```javascript
// Test with extremely long text
const longText = "This is a test text.".repeat(1000); // Approx. 10,000 characters
browser_type(element="Original Prompt Input Box", ref="e54", text=longText);

// Test with special characters
const specialChars = "🚀🎯💡🔥⭐️🌟✨🎉🎊🎈<script>alert('test')</script>";
browser_type(element="Original Prompt Input Box", ref="e54", text=specialChars);
```
