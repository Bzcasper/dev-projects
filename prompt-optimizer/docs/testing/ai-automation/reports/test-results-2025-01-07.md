## Fix Verification Tests

### Settings Persistence Verification Test
- **Execution Time:** 2025-01-07 17:10
- **Test Content:** Verify the persistence of language and theme settings.
- **Test Steps:**
  1. Switch UI language to Chinese → Refresh page → ✅ Language remains Chinese.
  2. Switch theme to blue mode → Refresh page → ✅ Theme remains blue.
  3. Verify built-in template language setting → ✅ English template names are maintained.
- **Result:** ✅ All settings persistence functions work correctly.
- **Conclusion:** The `setI18nServices` fix is effective, and the settings persistence issue is fully resolved.

### Duplicate Toast Message Verification Test
- **Execution Time:** 2025-01-07 17:30
- **Test Content:** Verify the toast message for the connection test in model management.
- **Test Steps:**
  1. Open the model management interface.
  2. Click the "Test Connection" button for the Gemini model.
  3. Observe the number of success messages.
- **Result:** ❌ Confirmed the existence of a duplicate message issue.
  - Two identical "Gemini connection test successful" messages appeared.
  - The content was identical, with a slight difference in position.
- **Conclusion:** The duplicate toast message issue exists and needs to be fixed.

### Duplicate Toast Message Issue Resolution
- **Debug Time:** 2025-01-07 18:00
- **Symptom:** A single click on the test connection button results in two identical success toasts.
- **Debug Findings:** User-provided logs confirmed only one function call and one toast creation.
- **Root Cause:** Two instances of the `ToastUI` component existed.
  1. `MainLayoutUI` component contained one `ToastUI`.
  2. `App.vue` rendered another `ToastUI`.
  3. Both components shared the same global `toasts` state, causing the same toast to be rendered twice.
- **Fix:** Remove the duplicate `ToastUI` component from `App.vue`.
- **Files Fixed:**
  - `packages/web/src/App.vue`
  - `packages/extension/src/App.vue`
- **Verification Result:** ✅ Fix successful.
  - 2025-01-07 18:15 MCP test verification.
  - Clicking the Gemini test connection button now shows only one success toast.
  - The duplicate message issue is resolved.

### History Record Deletion Final Verification
- **Verification Time:** 2025-01-07 19:00
- **Final Conclusion:** The delete function works perfectly.
- **Detailed Test Process:**
  1. Created a new history record (optimization for "Introduction to Machine Learning").
  2. Opened the history interface, confirmed 1 record.
  3. Clicked the delete button, confirmation dialog appeared.
  4. Confirmed the delete operation.
  5. Waited 2 seconds for the async operation to complete.
  6. The interface correctly updated to "No history records yet."
- **Key Finding:** The previously observed "delay" was a test timing issue. The asynchronous delete operation takes about 2 seconds.
- **Final Conclusion:** The delete function was working correctly from the start; there was no issue.
