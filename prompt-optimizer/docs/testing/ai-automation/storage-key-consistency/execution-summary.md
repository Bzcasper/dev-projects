# Storage Key Consistency Test Execution Summary

## üìã Test Overview

### Test Background
While fixing the user-reported issue "incomplete userSettings structure in exported JSON," systemic storage key consistency problems were discovered. This test suite aims to verify the fix and establish a long-term monitoring mechanism.

### Root Cause Analysis
1.  **Theme Setting Key Mismatch** - UI components used a short key name, while DataManager expected the full key name.
2.  **Built-in Template Language Key Mismatch** - The service layer used a short key name, while the export logic expected the full key name.
3.  **Core Services Using Magic Values** - String literals were used directly, lacking unified management.

### Corrective Actions
1.  **Unified Constant Definition** - Created a `storage-keys.ts` constants file.
2.  **Update Component Usage** - All UI components were changed to use constant references.
3.  **Fix Core Services** - `ModelManager`, `TemplateManager`, and `HistoryManager` now use constants.
4.  **Establish Test System** - Created AI-driven automated tests to ensure consistency.

## üß™ Test Suite

### TEST-001: Data Export Completeness Verification
**Objective:** To verify that all user settings can be exported correctly.

**Execution Status:** [Pending/In Progress/Completed]
**Result:** [Pass/Fail/Partial Pass]

**Key Verification Points:**
- [ ] Exported JSON contains 8 user setting items.
- [ ] All key names use the full format (`app:settings:ui:*`).
- [ ] Theme, language, model, and template settings are complete.

**Discovered Issues:**
- [Issue 1 Description]
- [Issue 2 Description]

### TEST-002: Legacy Data Import Compatibility Verification
**Objective:** To verify backward compatibility and automatic key name conversion.

**Execution Status:** [Pending/In Progress/Completed]
**Result:** [Pass/Fail/Partial Pass]

**Key Verification Points:**
- [ ] Old version short key names can be converted correctly.
- [ ] Settings are applied correctly after import.
- [ ] Re-exporting uses the new format key names.

**Discovered Issues:**
- [Issue 1 Description]
- [Issue 2 Description]

### TEST-003: Code Storage Key Consistency Check
**Objective:** To verify that no magic strings exist in the code.

**Execution Status:** [Pending/In Progress/Completed]
**Result:** [Pass/Fail/Partial Pass]

**Key Verification Points:**
- [ ] All UI components use constants.
- [ ] All core services use constants.
- [ ] Test files use the correct key names.
- [ ] Constant definitions are kept in sync.

**Discovered Issues:**
- [Issue 1 Description]
- [Issue 2 Description]

## üìù Lessons Learned

### Successes
1.  **Unified Constant Management** - Centralized definition avoided problems of scattered management.
2.  **AI-driven Automated Testing** - Increased test efficiency and coverage.
3.  **Backward Compatibility Design** - Ensured smooth migration of user data.

### Lessons
1.  **Importance of Early Standardization** - Storage key standards should have been established early in the project.
2.  **Necessity of Test Coverage** - More comprehensive testing is needed for storage-related functions.
3.  **Value of Code Review** - Regular code reviews can detect consistency issues early.

### Best Practices
1.  **Use TypeScript Types** - Leverage the type system to prevent errors.
2.  **Establish Checking Tools** - Automated tools are more reliable than manual checks.
3.  **Documentation First** - Establish standards before writing code.
