## ðŸ”§ Key Solutions

### Handling Tailwind Typography Conflicts

- **Solution**: A complete isolation strategy, manually rebuilding the layout.
- **Principle**: Prohibit partial application; completely remove `@apply prose`.

### Manually Rebuilt Markdown Layout
```css
.theme-markdown-content {
  @apply max-w-none;
}

.theme-markdown-content > :first-child { @apply mt-0; }
.theme-markdown-content > :last-child { @apply mb-0; }
.theme-markdown-content h1 { @apply text-2xl font-bold my-4; }
.theme-markdown-content h2 { @apply text-xl font-semibold my-3; }
.theme-markdown-content p { @apply my-3 leading-relaxed; }
```
