# 106-template-management - Template Management Feature

## Overview
Development, optimization, and troubleshooting of the template management feature, including CRUD operations for templates and related user experience enhancements.

## Timeline
- Start Date: 2024-12-30
- End Date: In Progress
- Status: ðŸ”„ In Development

## Involved Developers
- Lead Developer: Project Team
- Code Review: Project Team

## Document Checklist
- [x] `troubleshooting.md` - Template Management Troubleshooting Checklist
- [x] `event-propagation-fix.md` - Event Propagation Mechanism Fix (bug with built-in template language switching)
- [ ] `design.md` - Template Management Feature Design
- [ ] `experience.md` - Development Experience Summary (to be extracted from experience.md)

## Related Code Changes
- Affected Packages: @prompt-optimizer/core, @prompt-optimizer/ui, @prompt-optimizer/web, @prompt-optimizer/extension
- Key Changes:
  - Implementation of template management functionality
  - Optimization of asynchronous operations
  - Improvement of error handling
  - **Refinement of event propagation mechanism**: Fixed an issue where the iteration page would not update after switching the language of a built-in template.

## Known Issues and Solutions
- "Template not found" error on deletion: Missing `await` keyword in asynchronous method call.
- Modal rendering issue: Missing `v-if` directive to control visibility.
- Template manager invocation logic: Association between optimization mode selection and template management.
- **Iteration page not updating after switching built-in template language**: Missing event propagation mechanism; a complete event propagation chain needs to be established.

## Subsequent Impact
- Improved user experience for template management
- Reduced errors related to template operations
- Laid the foundation for advanced template features

## Related Features
- Prerequisite: 105-output-display-v2
- Successor Feature: To be planned
