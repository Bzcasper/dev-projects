## 🏗️ Core Principles

### The Golden Rule
- **Highest Guiding Principle**: For an element to stretch as a Flex child (`flex-1`), its direct parent must be a Flex container (`display: flex`).
- **Constraint Chain Integrity**: All related parent and child elements from top to bottom must follow Flex rules.
- **The Golden Combination**: `flex: 1` + `min-h-0` (or `min-w-0`).

### Implementation Points
```css
/* Parent Container */
.parent {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 100vh; /* or another explicit height */
}

/* Dynamic Child Item */
.child {
  flex: 1;
  min-height: 0; /* Key: allows shrinking */
}

/* Scrollable Container */
.scrollable {
  flex: 1;
  min-height: 0;
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

## 🔧 Important Fix Case

### TestPanel Complex Responsive Layout Fix
- **Problem**: Flex layout issue, content was being pushed upwards.
- **Cause**: Incomplete height constraint propagation, improper handling of mixed layout modes.
- **Solution**: A complete flex constraint chain, with the title marked as `flex-none`.
