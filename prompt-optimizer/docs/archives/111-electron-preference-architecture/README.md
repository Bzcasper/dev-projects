# Electron PreferenceService Architecture Refactoring and Race Condition Fix

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

**Project Number**: 111
**Project Name**: Electron PreferenceService Architecture Refactoring and Race Condition Fix
**Start Date**: 2025-01-01
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-01
**Status**: âœ… Completed

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

### Primary Goals
1.  **Solve the issue of UI state not persisting in the Electron environment** - by refactoring the PreferenceService architecture.
2.  **Fix race condition errors** - resolve the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'preference')" error.
3.  **Unify API access paths** - standardize API call methods in the Electron environment.

### Technical Goals
-   Replace the UI layer's direct dependency on `useStorage` with `PreferenceService`.
-   Implement the IPC communication mechanism for the Electron environment.
-   Establish an API availability check and delayed initialization mechanism.

## âœ… Completion Status

### Core Functionality (100% Complete)
-   âœ… Created the `IPreferenceService` interface and its implementation.
-   âœ… Implemented the `ElectronPreferenceServiceProxy` service.
-   âœ… Established a complete IPC communication mechanism.
-   âœ… Resolved API initialization timing issues.
-   âœ… Fixed API path mismatch problems.

### Technical Implementation (100% Complete)
-   âœ… Enhanced environment detection: `isElectronApiReady()` and `waitForElectronApi()`.
-   âœ… Proxy service protection: `ensureApiAvailable()` method.
-   âœ… Optimized initialization timing: asynchronous waiting for the API to be ready.
-   âœ… Standardized API paths: unified use of `window.electronAPI.preference`.

### Testing and Verification (100% Complete)
-   âœ… 252/262 test cases passed.
-   âœ… Electron application started successfully.
-   âœ… Basic functionalities are running normally.
-   âœ… Race condition issue completely resolved.

## ðŸŽ‰ Key Achievements

### 1. Architectural Improvements
-   **Service Layer Decoupling**: The UI layer no longer directly depends on `useStorage`.
-   **Environment Adaptation**: Web and Electron environments use a unified interface.
-   **Proxy Pattern**: The Electron environment uses a proxy service for IPC communication.

### 2. Stability Enhancements
-   **Race Condition Fix**: Thoroughly resolved initialization timing issues.
-   **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added API availability checks.
-   **Timeout Protection**: A 5-second timeout mechanism prevents infinite waiting.

### 3. Improved Developer Experience
-   **Unified API**: All environments use the same PreferenceService interface.
-   **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive debugging information and error messages.
-   **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript type definitions.
