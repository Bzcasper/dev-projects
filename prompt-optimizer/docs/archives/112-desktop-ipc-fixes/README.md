# 112 - Desktop IPC Fixes

## 📋 Overview

This document addresses IPC-related issues in the Desktop version, including abnormal language switching functionality and an incomplete IPC call chain.

## 🎯 Key Issues

### 1. Abnormal Language Switch Button Display
- **Problem**: Displays "Object Promise" instead of the correct language name.
- **Cause**: An asynchronous interface was used as a synchronous value.
- **Solution**: Unified the asynchronous interface design and completed the IPC call chain.

### 2. Incomplete IPC Architecture
- **Problem**: Missing methods in proxy classes, resulting in an incomplete IPC link.
- **Cause**: Inconsistency between interface definition and implementation.
- **Solution**: Established a complete IPC development process and checklist.
