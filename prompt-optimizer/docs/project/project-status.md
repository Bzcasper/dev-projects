## 13. Chrome Extension Development Experience

### 13.1 Icon Troubleshooting
-   Icon settings in `manifest.json` must strictly follow Chrome extension specifications.
-   Icons must be in a valid PNG format.
-   Icon dimensions must strictly match the declaration (16x16, 48x48, 128x128).
-   If an icon does not display, try testing with another confirmed working PNG image.
